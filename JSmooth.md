#Favorite Movie
My favorite movies are usually comedies or action genres. The Equalizer is probably my top action movie right now. I am a big fan of fantasy and love the mystical elements within the genre. I love anime and I can't really say much more. Here's a link to a website I've designed for up keeping my anime list.If you stick around I'll update this or let you know of anything I find that catches my attention. If you have any anime you like, feel free to share!

#Favorite Game
My favorite game currently is Final Fantasy XIV. I love mmorpgs. The thrill of going through an amazing story to reach huge end game dungeons and raids are insane. The classes are all pretty balanced and need one another to succeed during quests. I also play League of Legends from time to time. I have a love hate relationship with that game and can only play it when i get an itch.
