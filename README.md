# Unhinged

Unhinged is a text based adventure game inspired by A Dark Room. Unhinged was an idea originally from my classmate and friend JJLindsay. The concept ws originally going to be a Unity based game designed as a small adventure similar in nature to that of Zelda. The idea was adored by our class and as such Dr. Im allowed the entire to class to work on this project. We split into two seperate teams with one focused on designing a web based version using Ruby and the other focused on mobile application for Android and IOS.

Although this project was very uncharted territory for many of us, we made great progress. The web teams application is hosted on Heroku and is functional, but has not been completed. Please feel free to check out Unhinged.
